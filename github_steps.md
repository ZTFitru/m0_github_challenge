# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

- You would create a directory and a file in the directory on your local machine. You then would initialize it, add and commit. You also need to create a repository on GitHub and copy the SSH to the command line in your terminal.
